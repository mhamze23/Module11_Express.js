Module 11 Express.js: Note Taker

Your Task
Your task is to develop an application named Note Taker, which enables users to write and store notes efficiently. To achieve this, you need to create a back-end using Express.js, which will manage the retrieval and storage of note data in a JSON file. Your responsibility also involves linking the pre-existing front-end with the back-end and deploying the complete application to Heroku.
